<h1>ðŸ“š Project Overview</h1>
<p>This project focuses on forecasting residential energy usage and uncovering consumption patterns by integrating home characteristics, hourly weather data, and energy consumption records.
It simulates the impact of rising summer temperatures and provides actionable insights to assist energy providers in managing peak loads and optimizing grid efficiency.</p>
<br>

<h1>ðŸŽ¯ Business Objective</h1>
<p>Energy companies face increasing challenges in predicting and managing electricity demand, particularly with extreme weather events becoming more frequent. The primary objectives of this project were:
  <ul>
    <li>Forecast residential energy usage during hotter-than-average summer conditions.</li>
    <li>Identify key drivers of electricity consumption across different households.</li>
    <li>Propose data-driven strategies for mitigating peak demand pressures without costly infrastructure expansion.</li>
  </ul></p>
